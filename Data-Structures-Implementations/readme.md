# Data Structures Implementation Repository

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental data structures in Python (or the programming language you've used), including LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and Min Heap. These data structures provide essential tools for organizing and managing data in various applications.

## LinkedList

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element, known as a node, contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This implementation provides methods for inserting, deleting, and displaying elements within the linked list.

### Features

- Insertion: Add a new element to the linked list at a specified position.
- Deletion: Remove an element from the linked list based on its value or position.
- Display: Print the elements of the linked list in order.

## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This implementation provides methods to push elements onto the stack, pop elements off the stack, and check the top element.

### Features

- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
- Peek: Retrieve the top element without removing it.

## Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This implementation provides methods for enqueuing elements at the rear and dequeuing elements from the front of the queue.

### Features

- Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Remove and return the front element from the queue.


## Min Heap

A min heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. This implementation provides methods for inserting elements and extracting the minimum element from the heap.

### Features

- Insert: Add an element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
- Extract Min: Remove and return the minimum element from the heap.
- Delete: Removes the minimum element
